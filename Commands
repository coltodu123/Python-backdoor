python Login.py
Or we need to run the exe. We should have to have it
run on startup. And run for any user. We need the port 
for the os and might need to tweak Login.py or Login.exe
We also need to have the file hidden & have the file just
spawn in. To hide it we need to put it somewhere
But the problem is I cant cd out of it. So we need
to ftp it or make it work someother way.
What I would also like if for it to have me be the keyboard
or have me see the screen like a full on reverce tcp.
I could take screen shots but would need to be the keyboard
then I would have to share it. To the FPT server.
